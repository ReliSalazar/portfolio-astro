    Hello, my name is Kevin Enrique Loera Salazar, and I'm from Mexico. Since I
    can remember, I have always had a great afinity for computers, even my
    mother often tells me that I wanted to create robots and she talked about it
    all the time.
  </p>

    My first contact with software development was more or less in 2014, I tried
    to do a video game programming course with Unity using monodevelop and C#,
    but honestly it was too difficult, today I know that it is one of the most
    complex areas in the software development, but the good side is that the
    experience only gave me determination to start something simpler.
  </p>
  <p>
    shortly after I started learning C++ with the book
    <a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer">C++ Primer Fifth Edition</a
    >. What I like most about software development is the feeling of creating
    things from nothing, it is almost magical, you write a spell and something
    appears that a few hours ago did not exist and with which you can interact,
    and above all, it solves a problem.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    This isn't actually the first book I read about programming, but it's the
    most important for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time I also learned other technologies such as Python, C#, HTML, JS,
    React, Vue, TypeScript and Rust. Although I have also tried other things
    such as video game development with the GML or Python using Godot, or
    development for Arduino with C.
